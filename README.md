# Particle-Swarm_Optimization_algorithm_implementation_for_submarines #
Note: If you are not familiar with the Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm, I recommend reading about [Particle Swarm Optimization Algorithm](http://www.swarmintelligence.org/tutorials.php)

## Getting Started
[Link to src](https://github.com/chandrikabolla/Finding-Safe-route-for-Submarines/tree/master/psa_project/algoproject/src)-Click on the link to src folder of this project on github
### Prerequisites 
You may need to have your Java Development Environment setup already.
This project is built in Netbeans IDE, so it has the project structure of Netbeans. It's easy to find, open, run this project on Netbeans IDE if you have it already.
You can download latest version of this IDE from this [link](https://netbeans.org/downloads/) suitable for your local machine.
